# React Hydration Error Fixes

## Problem
The application was experiencing React hydration errors (#418) in production due to server/client mismatches. The error occurred because:

1. **Date initialization differences**: `new Date()` and `addDays(today, 1)` created different values on server vs client
2. **sessionStorage access**: Client-only APIs were being accessed during server-side rendering
3. **Date formatting inconsistencies**: Different date formatting between server and client

## Solutions Applied

### 1. Created ClientOnly Component
Created `components/ui/client-only.tsx` to handle components that should only render on the client side:

```tsx
"use client"

import { useEffect, useState } from "react"

interface ClientOnlyProps {
  children: React.ReactNode
  fallback?: React.ReactNode
}

export function ClientOnly({ children, fallback = null }: ClientOnlyProps) {
  const [hasMounted, setHasMounted] = useState(false)

  useEffect(() => {
    setHasMounted(true)
  }, [])

  if (!hasMounted) {
    return <>{fallback}</>
  }

  return <>{children}</>
}
```

### 2. Fixed WorkOrderBump Component
- Moved date initialization to `useEffect` to ensure it only happens on the client
- Used `ClientOnly` wrapper to prevent hydration mismatches
- Added proper loading states

### 3. Fixed AuthButton Component
- Wrapped with `ClientOnly` component
- Added proper `typeof window` check for sessionStorage access
- Improved loading state handling

### 4. Fixed Date Redirect
- Replaced `date-fns` format with native `toISOString().split('T')[0]` for consistent server-side date formatting
- Removed dependency on client-side date formatting for redirects

## Best Practices for Preventing Hydration Issues

### 1. Avoid Dynamic Content in Initial Render
```tsx
// ❌ Bad - creates different values on server/client
const [date, setDate] = useState(new Date())

// ✅ Good - initialize with null, set in useEffect
const [date, setDate] = useState<Date | null>(null)
useEffect(() => {
  setDate(new Date())
}, [])
```

### 2. Use ClientOnly for Client-Specific Features
```tsx
// ❌ Bad - sessionStorage access during SSR
sessionStorage.setItem("key", "value")

// ✅ Good - check for window object
if (typeof window !== 'undefined') {
  sessionStorage.setItem("key", "value")
}

// ✅ Better - use ClientOnly wrapper
<ClientOnly>
  <ComponentThatUsesSessionStorage />
</ClientOnly>
```

### 3. Consistent Date Handling
```tsx
// ❌ Bad - different formatting on server/client
const today = format(new Date(), "yyyy-MM-dd")

// ✅ Good - consistent server-side formatting
const today = new Date().toISOString().split('T')[0]
```

### 4. Use suppressHydrationWarning Appropriately
- Only use on the `<html>` element for theme providers
- Don't use as a blanket solution for all hydration issues

## Testing Hydration Fixes

1. **Development Testing**:
   ```bash
   npm run build
   npm run start
   ```

2. **Check for Hydration Warnings**:
   - Open browser dev tools
   - Look for hydration warnings in console
   - Test with different themes and user states

3. **Production Testing**:
   - Deploy to production environment
   - Test with different browsers and devices
   - Monitor for hydration errors in production logs

## Additional Recommendations

1. **Add ESLint Rules**: Consider adding ESLint rules to catch potential hydration issues
2. **TypeScript Strict Mode**: Ensure strict TypeScript settings to catch type-related issues
3. **Testing**: Add integration tests that verify server/client consistency
4. **Monitoring**: Set up error monitoring to catch hydration issues in production

## Files Modified

- `components/ui/client-only.tsx` (new)
- `components/work-order-bump/work-order-bump.tsx`
- `components/home-page/auth-button.tsx`
- `app/work-order-bump/page.tsx`

## Verification

After applying these fixes:
1. Build the application: `npm run build`
2. Start production server: `npm run start`
3. Test all major user flows
4. Verify no hydration warnings in browser console
5. Test with different themes and user states
